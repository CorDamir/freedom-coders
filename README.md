## Product Vision

**Voices of Freedom** was created to help prevent and spread awareness of **Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking** during **National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month 2025**.

The website is a hub of educational resources that also inspires users to actively participate in the ongoing campaign.

Users can learn more about the campaign and how prevalent an issue modern slavery is by engaging with the resource links and reading the facts and survivor stories showcased around the site. There is also the option for users to test their knowledge via the interactive quiz.

## **Wireframes**

Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) and used as a blueprint for development of the site layout and structure.

- [Home Page - desktop and mobile wireframes](/docs/wireframe-home.png)
- [About Page - desktop and mobile wireframes](/docs/wireframe-about.png)
- [Take Action Page - desktop and mobile wireframes](/docs/wireframe-take-action.png)
- [Quiz Page - desktop and mobile wireframes](/docs/wireframe-quiz.png)*
- [Contact Page - desktop and mobile wireframes](/docs/wireframe-contact.png)


These are the initial wireframes but they have evolved as the project has progressed.

*Quiz page - it was decided that instead of a separate page for the quiz/zes, we would add them to the bottom of the info pages - e.g. Facts / Spot the Signs.

## **Design**

### **Logo**

![Voices of Freedom Logo Image](docs/VoF-example-brand-logo-pair.png "Three arms raised in the air with a banner behind.")

The logo was created using an icon by Ainnul Rofiq via [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/ainnul-rofiq)


### **Typography**

**FontJoy** was used to test aesthetic font pairings once the *Permanent Marker* font was chosen to be most similar to the icon style.

- *Permanent Marker* - logo font
- *Maven Pro* - Headings
- *Open Sans* - Body
- *Sans-serif* - as general backup font

![FontJoy font pairing example screenshot](docs/VoF-font-pairs.png "Screenshot of font pairings with placeholder text to main fonts together")

### **Colour Scheme**

A colour scheme was developed using **Coloors** (see below for reference), which aligned with the main icons and purple theme. This was used as a basis for background colour choices (though not all were utilised), with an emphasis on consistency with the icon theme and neutrality.

**Colour scheme used as inspiration for styling**:

![Colourscheme image from Coloors](docs/# "Purple, grey and blue colour gradient with associated HEX styling codes: 6864F7, 0E1081, 524ED2, BF9CF6, BBC1DA, 052A75")
